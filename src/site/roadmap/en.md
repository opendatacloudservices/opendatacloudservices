    <h2>Towards a unified infrastructure for Open Data in Germany</h2>

  <h3>Preface and Vision</h3>
  <p>Open Data is creating transparency and can foster social, ecological and economic innovation. In its current state Open Data and the underlying infrastructures are staying behind on those potentials. Through the ODCS we are trying to leapfrog open data towards its potentials. We have a serious interest in making those potentials accessible to all citizens and organisations. Our vision would be a cooperation with a government or non-profit organisation to ensure the free access to this platform.</p>

    <h3><span>Phase I</span> Data collection</h3>
    <p>A system was established that aggregates open data and it's meta data from a variety of different plattforms. The resulting data is being unified, updated and combined to create the basis for the ODCS.</p>

    <h3><span>Phase II</span> Data enrichment</h3>
    <p>The combined meta data is being cleaning, unified and optimized. Particularly spatio-temporal information on each data set are being refined. Semantic connections between datasets were unraveld, for example, to identify timeseries spread across multiples data sets. The resulting optimised meta data is the basis for our optimized open data search engine.</p>

    <h3><span>Phase III</span> Unified base data</h3>
    <p>Developers and companies require not only data for individual municipalities, but for the whole of Germany. Therefore, phase III, is focussed on establishing unified base data on the most important open data aspects and providing them through standardised APIs. Automated processes make sure, that the latest data is always available.</p>

    <h3><span>Phase IV</span> Historic data</h3>
    <p>Sadly administrations often only provide the latest data (e.g. land usage). But for indepth analysis of certain phenomena, developers and researchers require historic data, for example, to identify changes. To create a basis for this, our system is creating an Open Data Archive. In intervals spatio-temporal data is being aggregated, checked for changes and then archived for later retrieval.</p>

    <h3><span>Phase V</span> Innovative interfaces</h3>
    <p>The last phase is about empowering users, developers and municipalities to build innovative new applications, without having to deal with data processing. Therefore, a series of APIs is going to be build, which will combine various open data assets and deliver insights. From location and reachability analysis to local weather analysis, easy access to complex information to power innovative new services.</p>
